Breast cancer is sometimes found after symptoms appear, but many women with breast cancer have no symptoms. <br>
Therefore, early breast cancer screening is so important. <br>
The goal of screening is to catch cancers early. <br>
Early-stage cancers are easier to treat than later-stage cancers, and the chance of survival is higher. <br>

<br>Therefore, we built a checkup system that receives women’s information and appoint them appointments for them for breast cancer checkup/screening. 
Upon several questions, the patient’s case is determined whether is urgent or not. <br>

**Implementation:** <br>
Our system has a front end implemented with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JS and the backend implemented with Node JS, MySQL(Database).<br>

**2 Zip folders:** each contain 2 folders <br>
Home folder: home and signup page<br>
Patient folder: Patient view pages<br>
doctor folder: doctor view pages<br>
Admin folder: admin view pages <br>
